= Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing

The Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing feature enables the use of customized invoice numbering sequences. The core Kill Bill module uses a sequential numbering scheme for invoice numbers. This is common across accounts/tenants. While this is good enough for most use cases, some situations might require a tailored numbering sequence to meet specific business needs. This functionality is made possible through the Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing feature.

== Getting Started with Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing

This section provides a step-by-step approach to get started with Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing.

=== Installing the Aviate Plugin

The Aviate plugin can be installed as documented in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/how-to-install-the-aviate-plugin.html[How to Install the Aviate Plugin] doc.

== Enabling Aviate Custom Invoice Sequencing

To use the custom invoice sequencing feature provided by the Aviate plugin, ensure that KB is started with the following property:

[source, bash]
----
com.killbill.billing.plugin.aviate.enableCustomInvoiceSequencing=true
----

In addition, the Aviate Custom Invoicing feature requires some tenant-level configuration.  This can be done by executing the https://killbill.github.io/slate/tenant.html#add-a-per-tenant-configuration-for-a-plugin[per-tenant configuration] endpoint as follows:

[source, bash]
----
curl -v \
     -X POST \
     -u admin:password \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiKey: test7' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiSecret: test7' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
     -d '!!com.killbill.billing.plugin.aviate.AviateTenantConfig
  invoiceSequenceConfig:
    enabled: true
    scope: "PER_ACCOUNT" # or "PER_TENANT"
    start: 300001
    prefix: "INV-"
    suffix: "-2024"' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/uploadPluginConfig/aviate-plugin
----

Here:

* `enabled`: Specifies that custom invoice sequencing is enabled.
* `scope`: Specifies the scope of the custom invoice sequencing. Possible values are `PER_ACCOUNT` and `PER_TENANT`. `PER_ACCOUNT` ensures that each individual account within the tenant maintains its own independent invoice number sequence starting from the `start` value defined above. `PER_TENANT` applies a shared invoice numbering sequence across the entire tenant.
* `start`: Specifies the first value to start the invoicing with. This should be a numeric value.
* `prefix`: Specifies the invoice prefix. This is applicable only for invoice/email templates.
* `suffix`: Specifies the invoice suffix. This is applicable only for invoice/email templates.

Once the above configuration is done, any invoices created will start with `300001` and continue forward.

[NOTE]
*Note:* At the time of writing, custom invoice sequencing is not implemented for invoice/email templates.

== Using Custom Invoice Sequencing

Once the above configuration is done, all the invoices generated will use the custom sequencing as can be seen in the screenshot below:
